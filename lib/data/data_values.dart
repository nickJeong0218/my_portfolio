      I have used Python to analyze the data and predict the CO2 pollution based on fuel types in transportation. 
      To analyze the data, I have used the following machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, with the following data preprocessing techniques: Standardization, Normalization and Splines. 
      With the data analysis, I was able to find the significant patterns between CO2 pollution and fuel types in transportation.
